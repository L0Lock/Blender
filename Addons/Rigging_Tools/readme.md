**Rigging Tools** is a regroupment of little tools I made for me to automate redundant tasks (isn't that what programs are made for in the first place ?).

**Reset Stretch To**
In pose mode, used for reseting every "Stretch To" constraint in the armature.

**Set Inverse Child Of**  
In pose mode, used for setting the inverse of every "Child Of" constraint in the armature.
